# QuartTools - What it is?
We, developers, are lazy so I made some tools for easier life on the Internet. They are adding you some functions and custom themes for some websites.

This is an extension for browsers Chrome, Edge, Opera. It's free to use for everyone, so feel free to download :)  

***Extension was temporarily removed from extension marketplace. I want to provide the best experience possible.***

## Status
This project is currently in an early stage of development. The code contain unfinished and messy sections. I will fix it, don't worry.

This is our starting point.

## FAQ - Maybe you are wondering
### Can I contribute?
Yes! Of course!   
I'm making this project Open Source, so everyone can contribute, and make these tools awesome.:)

For themes..
You can find a [documentation here](/themes/README.md). and you can submit some theme for web you'd like to. ðŸ˜Š  

You'll get a badge `Contributor` on your `QuartTools` account (same account as [Quartyn's Services](https://quartyn.com/account/)) and your name will also be in that CSS file. 

I am very grateful for every contribution you make. <3

### Hmm, can I request Theme?

No worries! You can also request theme for website you want. You need to go to `Themes` tab in QuartTools and on right up click "Request Theme" > "Request New Theme"
